# Virus-Ticker-Widget
The term virus refers in this app to SARS-CoV-2.


This android app allows anyone to display the amount of recovered/death/confirmed infected people of a country on the homescreen as a widget.



Also, you can view popular websites in a fullscreen in-website WebView to see more of the website.


Feedback is welcomed!


UPDATE
Due to some format changes in the repository of the JHU the widgets are currently not working.
